Would you rather go HARD for 11 months straight, then crash for 4 weeks? Or build something sustainable that doesn't require you to completely unplug just to survive?

I've tried both. And honestly? I'm still figuring this out.

Here's the thing – that 4-week break sounds amazing on paper. But giving 200% the rest of the year? It burned me out. It wasn't satisfying. It was just... exhausting. 😮‍💨 Going on that break felt great, but its back to the grind after that.

But then here's where it gets tricky. When I DON'T give that 200%, I feel like I'm moving too slow. Like I'm falling behind. And in tech? That feeling hits different. The industry moves FAST, and if you're not sprinting, you're irrelevant.

So yeah, I'm torn.

What I LOVE about Tim's approach: 💡

Taking that step back forces you to do TWO critical things:

- You actually review what's working and what's not in your life - not just professional, but the other important aspects too
- You HAVE to build real systems. Your team needs to function without you. That's not optional anymore.

But here's where I disagree: 🤔

Tim says you should discover non-business pursuits during those 4 weeks. Like that's when you figure out your hobbies and interests.

Wait... shouldn't that be happening ALL YEAR ROUND?

Why are we treating "having a life outside of work" like it's a once-a-year thing? Shouldn't balance be constant, not something you binge on for a month?

I don't have this figured out yet. But I'm curious – what works for YOU?👇
