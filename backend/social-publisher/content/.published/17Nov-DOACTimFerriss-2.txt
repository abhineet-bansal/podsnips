"Follow your passion." "Find your ikigai."

Honestly, that never clicked for me. Too vague. Too much noise.

Tim Ferriss? He's got something way simpler:

Pick projects that improve relationships or skills. 🎯

That's it. Seriously.

Here's why this works: You can't predict if your project will succeed. You just can't. But you CAN predict what you'll learn and who you'll get close to.

Those are the variables YOU control. You can bet on those.

And check this out - relationships and skills don't just add up. They multiply. ⚡

Think about it. If you've got the right skills AND the right connections? What's stopping you?

But here's where it gets really powerful: 💪🏼

The relationships and skills have to transcend the project itself. 

Let me show you what I mean:

❌ I'll work with this person I can't stand just to finish this project.

✅ I'll work with this founder I actually admire - not just for this project, but for what this relationship could become years from now.

❌ I'll learn this specific tool for this one gig.

✅ I'll build skills that will be handy for my future ventures.

The project might totally fail. But if you picked the right people and learned the right things?

Those compound. They carry over. They open doors you didn't even know existed. 🔑

So here's my question for you:

What relationship or skill are you building next? 

Keep it simple.
